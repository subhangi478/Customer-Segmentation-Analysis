Project Overview
-This project performs customer segmentation analysis for an e-commerce company using K-Means clustering.
The goal is to group customers based on income, purchase frequency, and spending behavior to enable targeted marketing strategies and improved business decisions.

Objectives
-Analyze customer purchasing behavior
-Segment customers into meaningful groups
-Visualize customer clusters
-Provide actionable business insights

The dataset contains customer demographic and purchase information, including:
-Income
-Product-wise spending
-Purchase channels (Web, Store, Catalog)
Source: iFood Customer Dataset

Technologies Used
-Python
-Pandas, NumPy
-Matplotlib, Seaborn
-Scikit-learn
-Google Colab

Project Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature engineering (Total Spend, Total Purchases)
4. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
5. K-Means clustering
6. Visualization of customer segments
7. Business insight generation
